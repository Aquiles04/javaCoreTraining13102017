Right now what I understand of maven

Maven is a dependency manager used for making setting of enviroments
faster and less complex.
Maven has a place named Artifactory? which is a place 
where all the jar압 are stored and where we download from.

The file pom.xml on the "main" project is the responsible for storing the 
information about it압 dependencies and can be the parent of other projects/poms
on the same project.
The file pom.xml on the main project can be a parent for other pom.xml files which 
are responsible for their own module.

Having a parent it압 important to make sure that only the parent has to 
download the common dependencies for the project.
 
Maven has a few lifecycles:

clean - responsible for cleaning the project 
compile - gets source code and compile it
install - download it압 dependencies and build the project
deploy - deploy the project?
validate - seach for error on project see if all information necessary it압 there
package - (dont know, just know it exists).
